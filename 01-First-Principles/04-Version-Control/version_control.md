As a developer you are going to write a lot of code. A hell lot.
But that needs to be synchronized with your team members as they should always have the latest copy of code with them.

I have found  myself in a fix a multiple times when one of my team members used to have an older version of code and he hadnt updated his codebase. Your best bet to keep it in check would be to use a version control.

A verison control not only lets the whole team to have a centralized updated codebase but also solves the whole chaos and mess that an unregulated development brings.

# What is a version control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

### Local VCS
Many peopleâ€™s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory.
A simple yet error prone approach.
To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.
