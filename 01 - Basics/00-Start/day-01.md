Well it is fantastic that you have decided to start your journey as a Software Engineer, but first you should decide what you want to be.
If you wish to be an UX-UI developer then you may not find much relevance here but if you want to get your hands dirty in core software development, this is the way to go. I know there are probably multitudes of resources out there to learn and code but I find them overwhelming. It becomes hard to digest all those information in one bit. You need a much simpler and smarter approach to gain the requisite information.

If you have been using a Windows OS then its probably time to ditch that in favour of Linux but, if you can carry windows with you gracefully by all means do!

That been said, lets get on with what we intend to cover in the first 3 days.

* Linux and Bash scripting
* Web-Architecture
* Version control and Git syntaxes
