# SoftCode - Learn Software Engineering from scratch

## The project

* If you are anything like me, You must have dreaded writing a sorting algorithm in your college years.
* In your final year however you had to take a job that requires you to code extensively but you remember you are not very good at it.
* You're in a fix and you so want to get better at it. Do you go back to the school to learn the concepts from ground up or do you skim through the necessary topics?
* This repository is a documentary of my journey from how I faced a similar situation and worked my way through it.

I think you can benefit a lot from it.

Happy Learning :)
